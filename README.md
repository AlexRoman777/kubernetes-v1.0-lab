âœ¨ This tutorial will allow you to run Kubernetes v1.0 - in your browser by making use of the Free Google Cloud Shell tier that can be used without enrollment. Click the "Open in Google Cloud Shell" button, sign in with Google, do not trust the repo (as we want to run this as an ephemeral environment that is discarded after use) and then follow the tutorial on the right hand side ðŸš€
